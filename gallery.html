            <h2>Austria</h2>
            <img class="img" src="images/Austria.jpg" alt="" width="500">
            <p class="g_p">Though Austria is a small country, it is so rich in history, culture and gorgeous natural sites. Approximately 62% of the country is covered with mountains. Thus, it is the ideal place for all kind of winter sports. Discovering this wonderland could be one of the best experiences you'll have. </p>

            <h2>Tokyo</h2>
            <img class="img" src="images/Tokyo.jpg" alt="" width="500">
            <p class="g_p">Tokyo is a city of surprises — ancient temples are nestled among modern skyscrapers and you're just as likely to see someone wearing a cosplay costume as you are to see someone dressed in a traditional kimono. And even though Tokyo is the most populated city in the world, the streets can be almost eerily silent.
                <br> 
        You'll find every modern convenience (and then some), but because Japan was closed off to the rest of the world for many years, tech evolved in a way that reflects the Japanese psyche, English is not widely spoken, and the far-reaching effect of globalization is still minimal. It is a true breath of fresh air among the myriad destinations that lost themselves in their quest to cater to tourists and meet global ideals.</p>

            <h2>India</h2>
            <img class="img" src="images/taj-mahal-india.jpg" alt="" width="500">
            <p class="g_p">India's landscapes are as fantastically varied as its cultural traditions. From the snow-dusted peaks of the Himalaya to the sun-splashed beaches of the tropical south, the country has a bounty of outdoor attractions. You can scout for big jungle cats on scenic wildlife safaris, paddle in the shimmering waters of coastal retreats, take blood-pumping treks high in the mountains, or simply inhale pine-scented air on meditative forest walks. Among all these natural treasures is a wealth of architectural gems, from serene temples rising out of pancake-flat plains to crumbling forts peering over plunging ravines.</p>

            <h2>Singapore</h2>
            <img class="img" src="images/singapore.jpg" alt="" width="500">
            <p class="g_p">Immaculate, efficient Singapore is a miraculous sight, particularly for travelers familiar with modern Asian metropolises. The city maintains a remarkable balance of green space and skyscrapers, in addition to sustaining substantial ethnic enclaves like Little India and Chinatown. This motley group of cultures has brought to this former British colony something special – a common mindset. Singaporeans are determined and patriotic; they are proud of what they have achieved </p>
